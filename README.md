# DSG Predictive Modelling
This notebook contains a documented and explained code for applying various machine learning algorithms to the famous MUSHROOM dataset. Notebook has been structured in a well-ordered manners. Please feel free to directly go through my '.ipynb' notebook to get a better understanding of the modelling.  
  
The notebook is open for pull-requests. Feel free to fork and work on your own :D
  
  
# Basic Overview of notebook
### Problem Statement -
* Given are 24 attributes of 'Mushrooms'
* We need to classify them as 'edible' (=e) or 'poisonous' (=p)

### Dataset Given -
* MUSHROOM Dataset
* Train Dataset - 'mushroom_train.csv'
* Test  Dataset - 'mushroom_test.csv'

### Evaluation Metric used - 
* Accuracy - Number of correct predictions / Number of total predictions
